 A simple code for number plate detetction using ImageResNet V2

 ## What is ImageResNet V2?
 Inception-ResNet-v2 is a convolutional neural network architecture that combines the Inception family of architectures with residual connections, replacing the filter concatenation stage of the  Inception architecture. It's a deeper version of the Inception V3 model and is trained on a large dataset like ImageNet. 
 Here's a more detailed breakdown:

 **Architecture:**
  * Inception-ResNet-v2 builds upon the Inception architecture, known for its use of multiple convolutional filters of different sizes to capture features at various scales. 
  * It incorporates residual connections, which allow information to flow directly from earlier layers to later layers, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and enabling the training of 
     deeper networks. 
  * It replaces the filter concatenation stage of the Inception architecture with residual connections.
   
**Training:**
  * Inception-ResNet-v2 is trained on a large dataset like ImageNet, which contains millions of labeled images.
  * This training process allows the network to learn to classify images into 1000 object categories.
  
**Usage:**
  * Inception-ResNet-v2 can be used for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. 
  * It's a popular choice for transfer learning, where the pre-trained network is used as a starting point for fine-tuning on a new dataset.
